# Arrays in Python:
# An Array is collection of elements of the same datatype stored in a continuous memory location. 
# Arrays are used to store mutliple values in a single variable.
# Why Arrays?
# Easy to manage multiple values. 
# Allows Faster operations like searching and sorting. 
# Useful in mathematica and scientific problems. 
# Saves Memory. 

# Array VS Lists:

# Importing the array module. 

import array as arr
# Creating an array:
Numbers = arr.array('i',[1,2,3,4,5])
print(Numbers)
